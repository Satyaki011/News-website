# News-website
Live News is a clean and minimalistic news web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It displays neatly arranged news cards with category tabs like IPL, Finance, and Politics, designed to look like a modern news site interface.

This project was made to sharpen my front-end structure, layout design, and DOM handling skills while building something visually pleasing.
